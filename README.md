This Application is designed for avid readers / audible listeners to access their history, add memorable details, add service purchased on, and many many more descriptors.
It also allows for fast searching on certain platforms when given an Author, Title, or Narrator. 
Provides better accessibility for large text areas in comparison to excel or sheets, allowing for quoting and summaries to be included in a visually pleasant format.
Provides search and sorting functionalities, with many others to come

Fast database insertion / Editing


* TO USE THE APPLICATION

* UPDATED

Simply open the "Dist" folder given, and download the raw file (Your Antivirus Software will likely flag this application as a trojan as it is an untrusted executable) 
You may have to disable / run anyway when asked by your windows antivirus 
- This is soon to be updated and fixed (hopefully)

Follow the instructions given on the App or read below:

You must go to the link given on the first page and create a Google API Key, follow the instructions there. You must do this in order to access books and book covers as they will be pulled from Google's database

(You will only need to do this once, with a limit of loading 1000 unique books per day, where previous books will be saved after the first day so you can have thousands of books after a few days)
or
(You can add multiple API Keys if you're in a time crunch / have at minimum 10000 unique book loads per day)

Once the app is on your desktop, simply open it, and copy the path of the spreadsheet you'd like to use (likely at the top of your recently downloaded files, you will only need to do this once). 
Your file should look something like C:User/Name/Location/etc - PLEASE REMOVE ANY "" FROM YOUR PATH - 

Thats it :D





* OUTDATED

- You must, format your spreadsheet as required, or modify ANY and ALL SQLITE code to match the format of your spreadsheet, this should be possible with limited programming experience, as you must simply change the name of the headers to match your own sheet.
- If your sheet matches the format of the one given, download your sheet, and follow the instructions given in the "convert_to_db.py" file. DO NOT MODIFY AND OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS PROGRAM.

I intend to update this application to include a spreadsheet reader which will automatically format your spreadsheet to fit with this application, but this is not possible as of right now. 


* This application will soon be transitioned into a downloadable application, to make it more accessible for those with limited understanding of GitHub. 
* Keep in mind this application is stored directly onto your hard drive. Please make backups of your spreadsheet / Database periodically, as this app does not come with cloud storage YET
