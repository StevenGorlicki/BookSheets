* TO USE THE APPLICATION

*WARNING* You may be prompted to disable windows antivirus or click, "Run Anyway" when downloading or opening the app for the first time.
This is because Windows automatically flags executable files as potential threats, this app has no threat to the health of your computer.

Follow the instructions given on the App or read below:

Go To the Link below to Create a Google API Key, as it is required to pull book covers from online into your own application. Click, "Create Credentials," "API Key," and then press "Show Key" and put it into the app when prompted. You will only need to do this ONCE.
