This Application is designed for avid readers / audible listeners to access their history, add memorable details, add service purchased on, and many many more descriptors.
It also allows for fast searching on certain platforms when given an Author, Title, or Narrator. 
Provides better accessibility for large text areas in comparison to excel or sheets, allowing for quoting and summaries to be included in a visually pleasant format.
Provides search and sorting functionalities, with many others to come

Fast database insertion / Editing


* TO USE THE APPLICATION *
  
- You must, format your spreadsheet as required, or modify ANY and ALL SQLITE code to match the format of your spreadsheet, this should be possible with limited programming experience, as you must simply change the name of the headers to match your own sheet.
- If your sheet matches the format of the one given, download your sheet, and follow the instructions given in the "convert_to_db.py" file. DO NOT MODIFY AND OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS PROGRAM.

I intend to update this application to include a spreadsheet reader which will automatically format your spreadsheet to fit with this application, but this is not possible as of right now. 

* Thanks for your time *

* This application will soon be transitioned into a downloadable application, to make it more accessible for those with limited understanding of GitHub. * 
* Keep in mind this application is stored directly onto your hard drive. Please make backups of your spreadsheet / Database periodically, as this app does not come with cloud storage YET *
